This project focuses on building a dynamic dashboard for CAWA Services, a car sales and service management system.
We integrated data from multiple sources to create a full overview of car inventory, insurance status, ownership details, sales transactions, and service history.

🛠️ Technologies Used:
SQL Server – for data storage, querying, and management.

Excel – for building the dashboard with PivotTables, PivotCharts, and interactive slicers.

Power Query – for data extraction and refresh.

🔍 Key Features:
Integrated Data Model combining tables: Cars, Insurance, Owners, Sales, and Service_History.

Live Connection between SQL Server and Excel for real-time updates.

Interactive Dashboard to view:

Active Insurance Policies

Total and City-wise Car Sales

Service Costs and Service Center Analysis

Year-wise Purchase Trends

Fuel Type, Transmission, and Owner Type Distributions

Automated Filters and Slicers to explore data easily (e.g., by City, Fuel Type, Year).

KPI Metrics such as Total Revenue, Average Sale Price, and Service Expenses.

🚀 How It Works:
Database Setup:
Structured multiple tables (Cars, Insurance, Owners, Sales, Service_History) in SQL Server.

Data Querying:
Wrote SQL JOIN queries to combine and clean the data.

Data Connection:
Connected Excel to SQL Server using Power Query.

Dashboard Building:
Built visualizations with PivotTables, PivotCharts, slicers, and conditional formatting.

Insights Delivery:
Delivered a user-friendly dashboard summarizing CAWA Services' operations and helping decision-makers track performance.

📈 Outcome:
Enabled quick insights into sales, service history, and insurance data.

Improved business decision-making through clear and clean visual reporting.

Enhanced skills in data modeling, SQL, Excel visualization, and real-world problem-solving.
